Although OT was the initial provider to engage with the patients, by the time they reached the dental providers, we were often the second or even third person they interacted with. As a treatment provider, I noticed that many of the children had already expended much of their energy, making it difficult to successfully complete an examination, let alone cleaning or restorative procedures in most cases. In the future, it might be more effective to have OT and dental professionals working together more closely. For example, OT could begin the session using visual aids and imagery to help prepare the patient, while the dentist observes and picks up on specific cues, behavior management techniques, and preferred communication strategies. This would help build a smoother transition into the dental treatment phase. Additionally, improved communication and handoff between OT and dental providers would be beneficial. There were several instances where patients were simply passed off to the dental team without a proper introduction or transition, which made it more challenging to establish rapport. Overall, it was a great event with a lot of potential, and I’m confident that with a few adjustments, the experience could be even more effective for both providers and patients."
