Some suggestions I have:  -If possible, have the professionals change locations rather than having children switch rooms for treatment to minimize transition time.   -Provide teachers with a social story and/or some of the equipment to touch and feel prior to the experience to prime them  -Provide training to paraprofessionals on the intent of this experience (i.e do not lie/force children into dental rooms. This breaks trust)  -Have fewer, more targeted visuals. Collaborate with the dentists prior to treatment to see which plan will be used  -Provide training to dental staff on communicating with the IDD community (reduce filler language, use first/then, do not use abstract language, do not ask complicated open ended questions, just in general language simplification--I.E saying ""please sit"" rather than ""hi buddy, I'm going to have you sit down in the chair for me okay?"")

Although OT was the initial provider to engage with the patients, by the time they reached the dental providers, we were often the second or even third person they interacted with. As a treatment provider, I noticed that many of the children had already expended much of their energy, making it difficult to successfully complete an examination, let alone cleaning or restorative procedures in most cases.  In the future, it might be more effective to have OT and dental professionals working together more closely. For example, OT could begin the session using visual aids and imagery to help prepare the patient, while the dentist observes and picks up on specific cues, behavior management techniques, and preferred communication strategies. This would help build a smoother transition into the dental treatment phase.  Additionally, improved communication and handoff between OT and dental providers would be beneficial. There were several instances where patients were simply passed off to the dental team without a proper introduction or transition, which made it more challenging to establish rapport.  Overall, it was a great event with a lot of potential, and I’m confident that with a few adjustments, the experience could be even more effective for both providers and patients."
